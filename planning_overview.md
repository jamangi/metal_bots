- **alarms**: functions that execute other functions at desired times
  - alarm(func_to_execute, time_of_execution(using timezones))
  - cdtimer(func_to_execute, time_until_execution)
  - recurring_alarm(func_to_execute, time_of_execution, recurrence_interval)
- **datastructs**: classes for interacting with jsons. Each instance covers one json, and takes the filename as input. Maybe the filenames can just be global variables for convenience
  - DataInv: base class for any list of dicts (would we want this?)
  - DataBase: base class for any dict of dicts
  - UserBase: subclass for any dict of dicts where each entry is a user
  - DiscordUserBase: subsubclass for dicts of dicts where each key is a discord_id and some standard user data is stored
- **util**: random funcs and stuff
  - time_now()
  - timezones_hash: hashmap with timezone codes and their time difference from UTC.
